# Sugarizer School Portal Chart
[Helm](https://helm.sh/) Chart for setting up [Sugarizer School Portal Server](https://github.com/nikhilm98/sugarizer-school-portal-server) deployment on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

[Sugarizer School Portal](https://github.com/nikhilm98/sugarizer-school-portal) is a Kubernetes cluster that is able to create/manage on-demand new Sugarizer Server instances. The following schema sum up the Sugarizer School Portal architecture.

![](images/ssp-architecture.svg)

## Usage
You can deploy **Sugarizer School Portal Server** instance by editing the values of the Values YAML file and running simple `helm install` command. The Sugarizer School Portal Server instance can be accessed by the browser by opening the hostName URL.

## Provider Support
Sugarizer School Portal Chart supports three providers:
- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (Amazon EKS)
- [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/kubernetes-service/) (AKS)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) (GKE)


**Note:**
- If you do not want to use HTTPS with Sugarizer School Portal, set `https` to `false` in `values.yaml`. The TLS Certificate will not be generated. You don't need to configure `cluster` in the `values.yaml` file in this case.
- If you want HTTPS then you need to set up Cloud DNS on your cloud provider and enter its  configuration in the `values.yaml` file.

## Setup Script (Automatic Setup)
You can use Sugarizer School Portal setup script to install dependencies, set-up the cluster environment and install the Sugarizer School Portal Chart on your AKS/EKS/GKE Cluster. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/NikhilM98/sugarizer-school-portal/tree/master/scripts).

Simply navigate into the scripts directory and run `sh setup.sh` to set up your cluster. You can read more about the setup process in the [documentation](https://github.com/NikhilM98/sugarizer-school-portal/blob/master/scripts/README.md).

## Environment Setup (Manual Setup)
If you don't have a cluster environment set-up, you can follow these steps to set-up a working environment.

### Install MongoDB Replicaset
You can install MongoDB Replicaset using [MongoDB Helm Chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) packaged by Bitnami.
The chart can be installed by following these commands:
```bash
# Add Chart Repository
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update

# Install the chart with the release name mymongodb (You can change the release name)
helm install ssp-mongodb bitnami/mongodb
```

### Install Kubernetes-Reflector
**Note:** Not required if you do not want HTTPS support.

[Reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector) is a Kubernetes addon designed to monitor changes to resources (secrets and configmaps) and reflect changes to mirror resources in the same or other namespaces. Reflector includes a cert-manager extension used to automatically annotate created secrets and allow reflection.    
You can install Reflector using its Helm Chart. It can be installed by following these commands:
```bash
# Add Chart Repository
helm repo add emberstack https://emberstack.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Install the chart with the release name reflector (You can change the release name)
helm upgrade --install reflector emberstack/reflector
```

### Install NGINX Ingress Controller
The [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/) provides an implementation of an Ingress controller for NGINX and NGINX Plus.

The Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that lets you configure an HTTP load balancer for applications running on Kubernetes, represented by one or more Services. Such a load balancer is necessary to deliver those applications to clients outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

Clone the chart repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/
cd deployments/helm-chart/
```
Open the `values.yaml` file and add these `customPorts` under `controller.service.customPorts`:
```bash
# For HTTP only support (AKS/EKS/GKE/Microk8s)
customPorts:
  - port: 8039
    targetPort: http
    protocol: TCP
    name: presence
```
Or
```bash
# If you want to have HTTPS support (AKS/EKS/GKE + Cloud DNS)
customPorts:
  - port: 8039
    targetPort: https
    protocol: TCP
    name: presence
```

Install the chart with the release name nginx-ingress (You can change the release name)
```bash
helm install nginx-ingress .
```
After installing the controller, point the hosts (domain name) to the External IP of the NGINX Ingress Controller. You can find the External IP by running:
```bash
kubectl get service --all-namespaces
```
Point the `A` record of domain to the External IP of the controller.

### Install Cert-Manager
**Note:** Required if you want HTTPS support. You also need to set up Cloud DNS on your cloud provider and enter its configuration in the `values.yaml` file. Not required if you do not want HTTPS support.

[Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, a simple signing key pair, or self-signed.

We use Cert-Manager to issue HTTPS certificates to the Sugarizer School Portal Server and its Sugarizer-Server deployments.

You can refer to Cert-Manager [installation documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) or simply follow these commands to install Cert-Manager on the cluster:
```bash
# Create the namespace for cert-manager
kubectl create namespace cert-manager

# Add the Jetstack Helm repository
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update

# Cert-Manager requires a number of CRD resources to be installed into your cluster as part of installation.
# Install CRDs as part of the Helm release
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --version v0.15.1 --set installCRDs=true
```

### Create Service Account
**Note:** Required only if you want HTTPS support.

**Instructions:**
- **AKS:**
You need to create a Service Principal for Azure. You can follow these [instructions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/azuredns/) to create a Service Principal for Azure.

**EKS:**
You need to use Amazon Route53 as Cloud DNS to allow certificate verification. You can follow these [instructions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/route53/) to configure Route53 for AWS.

- **GKE:**
You can create a Service Account for GCP by following these [instructions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/google/).
Save the service account key. It will be required in the values.yaml file while chart installation. It'll also be required if you set-up backup and restore using MGOB and intend to use gcloud bucket.

## Chart Installation (Manual Setup)

### Install Chart Using Helm
Navigate into the chart directory and run:
```bash
helm install ssp .
```
Where `ssp` can be the name you want to give to this chart.

## Backup and Restore data using MGOB
You can implement backup and restore feature on the Sugarizer School Portal MongoDB replicaset by using MGOB.
[MGOB](https://github.com/stefanprodan/mgob/) is a MongoDB backup automation tool built with Go. It features like scheduled backups, local backups retention, upload to S3 Object Storage (Minio, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and upload to gcloud storage.

To setup MGOB to automate MongoDB backups on Google Kubernetes Engine, you can follow this [documentation](https://github.com/nikhilm98/sugarizer-school-portal#backup-and-restore-data-using-mgob).
